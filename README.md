Definition
The RSA factoring challenge is a competition run from 1991 to 2007 that awarded cash prizes for the successful factorizations of certain large numbers.

The RSA algorithm (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is the basis of a cryptosystem -- a suite of cryptographic algorithms that are used for specific security services or purposes -- which enables public key encryption and is widely used to secure sensitive data, particularly when it is being sent over an insecure network such as the internet.

Background

Starting in 1991, RSA Data Security (now part of EMC Corporation) offered a set of “challenges” intended to measure the difficulty of integer factoring. The challenges consisted of a list of 41 RSA Numbers, each the product of two prime numbers of approximately equal length, and another, larger list of Partition Numbers generated according to a recurrence.

The first five of the RSA Numbers, ranging from 100 to 140 decimal digits (330–463 bits), were factored successfully by 1991. An additional 512-bit (155-digit) challenge number was later added in view of the popularity of that key size in practice; it was also factored in 1999.
